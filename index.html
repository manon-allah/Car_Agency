                In maintaining a luxury segment that satisfies affluent
                customers, BMW has ensured that its target group is always
                willing to return for new brands. With the target group 
                being the rich professionals and the affluent, BMW is able 
                to maintain high prices for its vehicles. BMW has positioned
                itself as a technologically advanced automobile company, 
                which incorporates the innovation in order to give the 
                customers an ultimate driving experience.
                This way, BMW has remained relevant for years with a brand 
                that can only be matched by a few.

                Jeep's current product range consists solely of sport 
                utility vehicles and off-road vehicles, but it has offered 
                roadsters and pickup trucks in the past and plans on 
                offering Jeep pickup trucks at some point in 2019.                    
                According to a Statista survey, in 2018, 2.25% of 
                respondents between the ages of 18 to 29 years stated that 
                they own a Jeep. Jeep Wranglers are one of the most popular 
                Jeep options available on the market and look as good as 
                they perform.

                if you want one of the specific combinations of style, 
                engine, and options, then you get the best available car 
                to suit your desires. The same statement can be made for 
                every new car. So don’t buy a Mercedes just for the name. 
                Buy it if it best suits your needs, wants, and wallet. 
                If you do buy it, then you get a modest level of car name 
                recognition, and a car that is fun for you to drive. 
                In my one-car experience the fuel mileage is excellent 
                considering the power (V-8) and weight of the car. 
                But only premium is deemed tolerable by the owner’s manual.

                The industry that Nissan currently operates in provides 
                lots of potential competitors for them as many automobile 
                companies are developing electric cars which are something 
                Nissan are very keen on focusing on. Nissan currently only 
                run a small market share of the industry so many competitors 
                are dominating the market such as Ford, Vauxhall etc. Nissans 
                competitors have many strengths and weaknesses against Nissan. 
                Some companies such as Ford focus heavily on fuel powered cars 
                which means they will have an advantage against Nissans fuel 
                powered range but Nissan will have an advantage over them with 
                Nissans electric cars and the amount of research that has been 
                put into it. Other companies such as Tesla whose main focus is 
                electric cars are a fairly big competitor towards Nissan and 
                the Nissan leaf range. Nissan will have a slight advantage over 
                them regarding the fuelled car range that Nissan offer because 
                Tesla offer no such models
